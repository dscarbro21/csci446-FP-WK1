NOTE: We did not receive a bug report from Robert Imbler

Bugs that apply to website or all games:
	How Do Play? box must be clicked near the center (vertically)
		----- FIXED! Clicking anywhere on the box brings up instructions

Bugs that apply to Checkers:
	Once reached end of game where black could move, red couldn't. Tie screen popped up.
		----- FIXED! Ties now only trigger at the appropriate time
	Checker is not highlighted
		----- Not a bug; there is no need to highlight the checker that will be moving
	No jump or slide animation
		----- Any attempt to implement this completely broke the game so we nixed it
	No multiple jumps possible
		----- FIXED! The check for ties function broke the double jump functionality; now there is a bypass for it
	Score not stored
		-----
	Once a checker moved and didn't jump another, but one still vanished.
		----- Having trouble replicating it, so we don't know about this one
	End up with possible moves, but none allowed
		----- Having trouble replicating it, so we don't know about this one
	Boing sound exists. I only heard it once. Ever.
		----- Not a bug; only happens during double (or more) jumps
	Checkers win screen stays when reset is pressed (same with tie screen)
		-----FIXED! setInterval function for animating winScreen was never cleared, causing an endless draw loop to hang the game

Bugs that apply to Dragon Drop:
	No timer
		----- FIXED! Added a visible timer that player can use to measure time remaining
	Billy can go on top of a cow.
		----- Not a bug; Billy is a skilled bullrider
	Billy's gravestone says "Rest in RIP". What does that mean?
		----- Not a bug; how is this a bug?
	Does not work in Firefox
		----- This doesn't seem fixable within a reasonable time frame
